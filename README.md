# C Programming Tasks

This repository contains practical C programming tasks covering different aspects of C programming in general and network programming in particular.

## Requirements
 - A C99 compliant compiler such as [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/), [clang](https://clang.llvm.org/), [pcc](http://pcc.ludd.ltu.se/) or [cparser/libfirm](http://pp.ipd.kit.edu/firm/)
   - When using a C compiler different from GCC, you need to change the `CC` variable in the corresponding `Makefile` or invoke `GNU Make` like this `make CC=clang`
 - [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)
 - A POSIX compliant operating system, such as Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD, Mac OS X, ...
   - Windoofs users should have a look at [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/)
 - Some tasks also require [GDB](https://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/), [Valgrind](http://valgrind.org/) and [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/)
 - On Linux and BSD this software can often easily obtained using a package manager
