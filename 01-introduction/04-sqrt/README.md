# Calculating the Square Root
## Motivation
It is finally time for a useful program and more complex program :-)

## Task
- You'll fine a more complex Makefile for this program
	- All sources files are stored in the folder `src`
	- All generated object files will be stored in the folder `obj`
	- The Makefile contains a "pattern rule" to create any object file in `obj`
	  from a C source file in `src` with the same name except for the file
	  extension. Try to locate and explain this rule.
- Open all C source files one by one. Each file contains a single function.
  Sadly, some functions are not yet implemented. Provide the implementation!
  (Hint: Each function is documented in detail, this will help you to
  understand what is missing.)
- If you're done, try to compile and test the program. Fix any Bugs you notice.
